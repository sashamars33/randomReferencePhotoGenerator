# randomReferencePhotoGenerator
A web app that returns a nature photo that can be used as a refernce photo for artworks either digital or physical. There is also an ability to edit the pictures by increasing and decreasing the saturation of the phooto.

Link to project: https://nature-photo-generator.herokuapp.com/

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

Optimizations
I hope to add selections for different photos based on catergory and have an option to tweak or edit the photo to make it easier to use as a reference. (ex. desaturate to better see value)

Lessons Learned: The biggest lesson learned form making this site is how front-end JavaScript makes requests to serverside Javascript.
